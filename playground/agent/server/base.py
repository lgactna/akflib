# This uses the "mixins" approach (or rather, subservices) to effectively

# application-specific state as well as ForTrace...? We can't really implement
# on_connect() in every single class, and I don't otherwise know if there's a way
# to maintain state within individual subservices. What do we lose by not having this?
